Anybody who has ever done binary simplification on more than four variables has probably used the Quine-McCluskey method of binary simplification.  You also know how time consuming and error prone this process can be by hand. For a project in my Computer Architecture class I designed software which can perform the steps of binary simplification for you.  Hopefully you can find this software as useful as I did!
